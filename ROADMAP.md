# AppTime — Roadmap

Read the next milestone, implement it bullet by bullet. After a bullet is done, change the dash - to an x, and commit.

## Milestone — Prepare to PlayStore submission

### Checklist

#### 0. Check legal concerns
x Once launched we'll expose the app to everyone, first review what issues may imply in legal concerns
x Consider a launch route that protects us, if there is not, it is fine
x Define protection strategy
x Build all materials/documents, manifests, don't know, what you can so we avoid being sued, I have no money or energy to handle that

**Strategy:** local-only architecture means LGPD exposure is minimal (no data leaves device). Key protections implemented:
- Privacy policy live at https://lsfcin.github.io/apptime/privacy_policy.html
- Disclaimer tile in Settings (not medical advice, not a medical device)
- Scientific claims softened from definitive to hedged ("may impair", "may spike")
- Play Console Data Safety form: mark "no data collected", "no account required"
- No INTERNET permission in manifest — reviewers can verify network-free claim instantly

#### 1. App identity & metadata
x Set a real `applicationId` (e.g. `com.lsf.apptime`) and confirm it is final — it cannot change after publish
  - Using `com.lsf.apptime` — confirmed final (changed from com.lucasf.apptime to bypass a MIUI install block)
x Bump `versionName` to `1.0.0` and `versionCode` to `1` in `build.gradle`
  - Set via pubspec.yaml `version: 1.0.0+1`
x Replace placeholder app name in `strings.xml` / `AndroidManifest.xml` (`AppTime`)
x Replace `ic_launcher` placeholder icon with final adaptive icon (foreground + background layers, 108dp safe zone)
x Add a short app description in PT-BR and EN (30 chars) and a long description (4 000 chars max) for the store listing
  - Written in docs/store_listing.md — ready to paste into Play Console

#### 2. Signing
- Create a release keystore (`keytool -genkey ...`) and store it outside the repo
- Configure `signingConfigs.release` in `build.gradle` (read credentials from `local.properties` or env vars — never commit the keystore)
- Build a signed AAB: `flutter build appbundle --release`

#### 3. Permissions audit
x Confirm every permission in `AndroidManifest.xml` has a visible rationale shown to the user (onboarding covers `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` + `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`)
x `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` — foregroundServiceType="specialUse" declared on both services with subtype properties
x Remove any unused permissions — `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` removed

#### 4. Privacy policy
x PlayStore requires a privacy policy URL for apps that request sensitive permissions (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`)
x Draft a minimal policy (data stays on-device, no network calls, no analytics); host it (GitHub Pages or similar)
x Add the URL to the store listing and optionally link it from the app's Settings screen
  - Live at https://lsfcin.github.io/apptime/privacy_policy.html

#### 5. Store listing assets
- Feature graphic: 1024 × 500 px
- Phone screenshots: minimum 2, recommended 4–8 (use emulator or device)
- Short and full descriptions translated to both PT-BR and EN
- Content rating questionnaire (IARC) — likely "Everyone"

#### 6. Target API & compliance
x `targetSdkVersion` must be ≥ 34 (current Play requirement for new apps) — uses `flutter.targetSdkVersion` (Flutter 3.x defaults to 35)
x Verify `compileSdkVersion` ≥ 35 — uses `flutter.compileSdkVersion`
x Declare `android:exported` on every `<activity>`, `<service>`, and `<receiver>` in the manifest — all declared

#### 7. Release track
- Create a Google Play Developer account (one-time $25 fee)
- Upload the AAB to the **Internal testing** track first and install via Play to verify signing + permissions
- Promote to **Closed testing** (beta) before production if desired
- Production review typically takes 1–3 days for a new app

#### 8. Post-launch minimum
- Set up crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics free tier, or just monitor Play's built-in ANR/crash dashboard)
- Prepare a `1.0.1` patch plan for any day-one issues
